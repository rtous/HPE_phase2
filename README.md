# HPE Phase 2

## Goals

- Render animations from a known dataset (e.g. Panoptic) 
- Easy mocap from videos with ROMP? 
- Explore weak points of Flashback project:
	- Best 3D HPE from monocular video (specially movie clips, with truncations, etc.).
	- Revise universal configurable 3D model (Meta Human, etc.)
	- Revise retargetting (hands, inevitable loss blend shapes?)
	- Revise shaders
	- Multiperson
- A library for common tasks
	- shape-to-skeleton regression (SMPL joint regressor matrix)
		- 
	- skeleton pkl to json util
	- 

## Goals 

## Panoptic dataset

- CMU Panoptic (includes hands)
- http://domedb.perception.cs.cmu.edu/
- toolbox: https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/panoptic-toolbox
- Monocular dataset: http://domedb.perception.cs.cmu.edu/mtc.html
- coco19 keypoint definition

### Setup Panoptic dataset

git clone https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/panoptic-toolbox
cd panoptic-toolbox

./scripts/getData.sh 171204_pose1_sample

This script will create a folder "./171204_pose1_sample" and download the following files.

	- 171204_pose1_sample/hdVideos/hd_00_XX.mp4 #synchronized HD video files (31 views)
	- 171204_pose1_sample/vgaVideos/KINECTNODE%d/vga_XX_XX.mp4 #synchrponized VGA video files (480 views)
	- 171204_pose1_sample/calibration_171204_pose1_sample.json #calibration files
	- 171204_pose1_sample/hdPose3d_stage1_coco19.tar #3D Body Keypoint Data (coco19 keypoint definition)
	- 171204_pose1_sample/hdFace3d.tar #3D Face Keypoint Data
	- 171204_pose1_sample/hdHand3d.tar #3D Hand Keypoint Data

##Â SoA key points

- SMPL is the core 
- SMPL (no hands, no face) still SoA
- Latest mostly get shape, then kinematics (easily with SMPL joint regressor matrix)
- still challenges on single image 3D HPE. Video-based works too, but they inherit most limitations of the image-based.
- multi-person can be solved with single-person in a top-down approach
- many latest works focusing on crowds (AMASS dataset)

## SoA stack (latest on top)

- Some techniques (general depth estimation -> point cloud -> mesh) [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/generate-a-3d-mesh-from-an-image-with-python-12210c73e5cc)
- Wanna try [ROMP](https://github.com/Arthur151/ROMP) 
- Panoptic paper: [Monocular Total Capture: Posing Face, Body, and Hands in the Wild](http://domedb.perception.cs.cmu.edu/mtc.html)
	- Hands and face :-)
	- Interesting use of 2D part orientation
	- Failure with truncation (the paper says)

- [SMPL-IK: Learned Morphology-Aware Inverse Kinematics for AI,Driven Artistic Workflows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08274.pdf)
	- Includes an SMPL retargetting strategy :-)

- EasyMocap and Neural Body ([Neural Body: Implicit Neural Representations with Structured Latent Codes
for Novel View Synthesis of Dynamic Humans](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15838.pdf))

- Video explaining SMPL in detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzpiSYTrRU0

## LOG stack

- Testing ROMP over charade full, works nice!, scale problem
- Running ROMP done (locally), problem with pngs.
- check panoptic dataset (has hands) to see if I can render animations with flashback from there. Not finished, just looked at the info. Being able to obtain the keypoints from a video is better for the projects.
